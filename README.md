A proposed way of setting up and administering examinations using blockchain





An unbiased and exam fraud prevention System:

The West African Examination Council(WAEC) which runs the multi national examination for both Junior High and Senior high schools has been using a failing system for sometime now. This has led to fraudulent practices at almost step in the process(from the creation of questions to the selection and acceptance of candidates into schools after the exams)  
There has been a long history of cheating scandals happening both within the headquarters of the institution and on the foregrounds. This has led to the drastic reduction and loss of trust in cretificates gotten from the Examinations( Although it is supposed to be the national official criteria for getting into your next level of school). 
Solving this problem will make the examination fair for every student, giving a chance to not only the people with power  but the entire body of candidates to pass and get into their dream schools.

Below is a description of the problems we plan on tackling using blockchain technology through the transparency, fairness and immutability it provides.

Problems:

Case 1:
Creation of exams: Teachers are selected across the country to submit into a pool of questions for each exam. After, the questions are audited and the ones approved are grouped together. 
Getting close to the exam day of a subject like math, a random set of questions is selected and used for all the students writing in the country that day. 
Now during the time of the questions being printed and sent to the schools, people in charge of the distribution leak the questions to some students and this leads to biased and unfair examinations.



Case 2:  
After the exam, students papers are gathered, sealed and sent over to the central authority. Once the papers of a particular subject is collected, they are redistributed to teachers who opt in to mark the exams. Although the papers gotten by teachers are somewhat randomized based on schools, it still gives room for falsification of grades by teachers as the names and schools are directly placed on the exam sheets( or answer sheets). There is also low transparency as. The papers of each student is not returned back to the student and we can therefore not know if it was graded right or wrong



Case3: 
After exams are graded. The grades of the students are sent back into one database calculations are made to determine which school to put you( out of the 4-5 schools you are allowed to select)
If your total calculated score meets the requirement of your top school, you will be placed in your selection. 
When a student does not like the school given them and knows a person working at the school allocation center, they can bribe them to modify either their grades or just place them in the school they want.

Solution:
Using blockchain, most of the problems can be eliminated through automation and transparency and moving most exams online.

Steps:
Each student can be given a unique id by a smart contract where only the smart contract knows the information of the students. 

For selection of questions:
 Each question in the question pool can be given a unique number. Then a smart contract using ChainLinks VRF, can be given the range of numbers assigned to the questions and the total number of questions to select for each section through randomness on the day of the exam. 
Or for a more complex way, because the exams are online, each student gets a question given to them by the smart contract and this question is stored alongside their id.
For identification of students:
Each student will be given that unique id the contract assigned their info. Upon arrival to the test centre, all the student needs to do is secretly enter their id/ fingerprint  into the smart contract using a UI. The smart contract returns  the face of the student and the examiner uses that to verify that the student is indeed not a fake (LOL).

For marking:
Because only the smart contract knows the information of the student, no randomness has to be done by a human. Each teacher can either :
Select their choice of ids(representing an anonymous student) 
Or the smart contract still randomizes the selection for each teacher
The marking is then done online with transparency and fairness as the  marks given for each answer to a particular idâ€™s question can also be reviewed by the whole organization and the student either realtime or later on.

For allocation of schools: 
A smart contract retrieves the grades for each id number, does the final calculation and selects the school for the id based on the score gotten. Once this is done, the final allocation and score info can be stored either on the blockchain or in a blockchain database where it is immutable or untouchable.


 
Exam -1
Verifying - 1,1, 1

Parts Needed:
Blockchain( ethereum)
Blockchain Database  for storing questions and info of students(image, name, school, etc)
Chainlink verifiable random numbers
One large smart contract or 4 separate ones for each process of the examination.

UI for pushing the data of the student, and returning their unique id. 

UI for displaying the randomized questions selected by the blockchain and for submission of exam

UI for teachers to mark the exams online and submit the scores

UI to display marks given by teachers

UI to display a students allocation upon entry of their unique id.
